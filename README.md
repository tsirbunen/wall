# WALL 
_**framing challenges as opportunities collaboratively online**_


### WALL is an online how might we -tool
Wall is an application that enables practising the **HMW (how might we) technique** collaboratively online. Both desktop and mobile will be supported.
If you are unfamiliar with the technique, have a look at **[this short introduction to HMW](https://medium.com/pm101/how-might-we-learn-about-this-framework-2add572be3d5)** by Thaisa Fernandes.  

### Architecture
This project is very much about becoming more fluent with Amazon Web Services, but also to improve my React/Typescript and Flutter skills. The WALL will be a **serverless** application, and it will consist of AWS-supplied building blocs and services wherever feasible:
- **Cognito**: authentication
- **React, Amplify SDK and Apollo Client**: web app
- **Flutter**: mobile app
- **AppSync**: full management of serverless implementation of GraphQL and integration to DynamoDB
- **Apache VTL**: GraphQL resolvers
- **DynamoDB**: persistent data storage
